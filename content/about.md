Hi ! I am Rownak. Currently a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics, IIEST Shibpur. I have completed my Masters in Mathematics from Gauhati Unuversity and Bachelors from B Borooah College, Guwahati. I am interested in Cosmology and probing the dark sector of the Universe.

At IIESTs I am working with Dr. Ujjal Debnath on Gravitational Lensing to understand the Dark Universe.
Besides, I have been also interested in Observational Cosmology and very much plan to work on the same.

When not working I tend to binge on TV Series or watch movies. I am a Moviebuff, Potterhead and a big fan of Indie Music.
